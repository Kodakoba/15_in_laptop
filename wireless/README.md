Looking at Intel's AX210 or RTL8852BE, assuming M.2 E Key connection is functional.

Edit: I'm gonna use a very similar one, the RTL8822CE chipset as its supported by the CM3588 officially.

Not a crazy performance model by any means, but the drivers should be better supported. (fingers crossed...)
